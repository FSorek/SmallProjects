# SmallProjects
Smaller various projects from university and unity

# Horror Game Prototype

Just a project I was working on but stopped developing because I started working on the Tower Defense game, wanted to work on it after I've finished with the other game but a game with almost exact same concept and ideas recently got released("Perception").


# MinecraftMod

Got a request from a friend to create a mod for minecraft that let's you spawn 4 different harmless pets. It was my first time working on a Minecraft mod which went successful. (The only thing I haven't finished there are textures and custom models)


# Multiplayer Game Prototype

My 2nd approach on making a multiplayer game (first one being a lock-step implementation for an RTS styled game which was an extremely tough challenge). I haven't created the lobby, I used a free asset and slightly modified it. This project was simply to learn more about networking and how it works. Will add a working .exe to download later.

# SQL with C / Java(MVC)

Two projects made for university that connect to the university server and create a working database. (Java is not fully completed, but has basics working like CRUD and GUI)
